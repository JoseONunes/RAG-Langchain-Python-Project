RAG-LangChain-Python-Project
This project implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using the LangChain framework in Python, inspired by this tutorial video. It combines retrieval-based systems with generative AI for efficient and accurate query handling.

Features
Embedding Comparisons: Leverages state-of-the-art embeddings to match and rank relevant data.
Database Creation: Supports scalable storage for embeddings to handle large datasets.
Query System: Integrates LangChain for seamless retrieval and generative response workflows.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
Install required dependencies listed in requirements.txt using:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Project
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/JoseONunes/RAG-Langchain-Python-Project.git
cd RAG-Langchain-Python-Project
Set up your embedding model and database following the instructions in the project files.
Run the query system to test retrieval and generation:
bash
Copy code
python query_system.py
Project Roadmap
Current Implementation:
Embedding storage and retrieval
Querying with LangChain
Future Plans:
Expand the system into a chatbot designed for summarizing and answering questions on lecture material.
Enhance database scalability and embedding efficiency.
Introduce advanced query optimization techniques.
