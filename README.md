# RAG-LangChain-Python-Project

This project demonstrates **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using the LangChain framework in Python. It is based on [this tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcqEUSNCn8I&t=748s) and focuses on combining retrieval systems with generative AI for efficient query handling.

---

## Features

- **Embedding Comparisons**: Efficiently match and rank relevant data for queries.
- **Database Creation**: Scalable storage for embeddings to handle large datasets.
- **Query System**: Integrates LangChain for seamless retrieval and response generation.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Install required dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Steps to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JoseONunes/RAG-Langchain-Python-Project.git
   cd RAG-Langchain-Python-Project
   ```
2. Configure your embedding model and database based on the provided scripts.
3. Run the query system:
   ```bash
   python query_system.py
   ```

## Roadmap

- **Current**: Embedding storage, retrieval, and LangChain integration.
- **Future**:
  - Build a chatbot to handle and summarize lecture material.
  - Enhance database scalability and query optimization.
